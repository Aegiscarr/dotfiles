# *aegis' nixos dots*
*alternative title: aegis struggles with following (simple) instructions for 8 hours*

## *hi, whats this for*
this repo currently contains configs for:
- SERRATA-NIX // the nix half of my main rig
- not much else, dont have other systems i need to share configs with for now lol

## *ok but why*
got bored one afternoon\
okay no but seriously i've been meaning to leave windows behind for quite some time now, and nix seemed like a fun route to go down. (it ended up taking ~12 hours getting this mess to a usable state so take that info as you will)\
eh well as long as i'm having fun all's well with the world

## *what's here*
- /homes // home manager setup. contains configs for hyprland and software i use, shared across all potential hosts
- /hosts // per system configs for drivers n stuff
- /wallpaper // no fuss wallpaper import
- readme // hi you're here now :3
- flake.lock // useful for keeping a system as is by freezing the config to a given point in time
- flake.nix // the main flake everything is built upon

## *special thanks*
- [rubiigen](https://github.com/rubiigen) for introducing me to this heaven- and hellscape :3

## *todo*
- windows exe compat layer
- redo widgets
- general cleanup as always because trying to get me to write clean code is like trying to connect a wiimote to a tree

---
i will not help debug stuff, lack of experience moment\
thanks for checking out my dots tho!\
